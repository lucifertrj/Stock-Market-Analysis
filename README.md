# Stock-Market-Analysis-under-production-using-MLflow

## About

- Stock market Analysis is a Time Series problem statement. 
- Achieved a loss of 0.03% and an accuracy rate above 80% using Tensorflow in combination with MLflow for stock market analysis.
- Developed a machine learning model to predict stock prices with high accuracy using MLflow's tracking and visualization features.
- Utilized MLflow's automatic logging and Hyperparameter tuning capabilities to optimize model performance and increase efficiency.

## Why MLflow

- MLflow provides a unified platform for tracking experiments, managing models, and sharing results, making it easier to manage the machine learning workflow.
- MLflow allows for easy integration with popular machine learning frameworks like Tensorflow, making it easier to incorporate advanced modeling techniques into the project.
- MLflow's built-in tracking capabilities enable easy comparison of model performance and quick iteration on model training and evaluation.
